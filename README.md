### Usage

Use `/lactation` slash command to open the Milk System window.

**Enable/Disable Lactation:** Enables/Disables milk production for active character.

**Breast Size:** Breast size affects milk capacity. *(Planned: EXP and level based breast growth system. For now you select your desired breast size manually.)*

**Milk Capacity:** Each time AI character sends a message, they produce milk based on their lactation level. Produced milk is stored in breasts until character is milked. If breasts milk capacity becomes full, *you are given a warning* and *AI character starts to feel discomfort*. If you don't milk them for a prolonged time, *they will be in pain and great discomfort.* *(Planned: There will be penalties in future.)*

**Milk Destination:** Choose destination for where you milk character to.

* **Global:** Character's milk is transfered to Global Milk Storage.

* **Personal:** Character's milk is transfered to Character's Milk Storage.

* **Waste:** Character's milk is consumed/wasted.

**Milk Level:** Milk level controls how much milk a character can produce with each message. When character is milked, they earn EXP.

**Actions:**

* **Milk by Hand:** Milk character with hands to the destination chosen above.

* **Suck Milk:** Drink milk from character's breast directly. *Milk is wasted regardless the destination.*

* **Use Machine:** Milk character with milking machine. (Faster than by Hand)

**Transfer:** Transfer milk between Global and Personal Milk Storages.

**Sell:** Sell the stored milk. The earned money is deposited into character's Wallet. *(Planned: Wallet will be used to buy items/upgrades in future.)*
